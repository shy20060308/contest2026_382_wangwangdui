# Wearable Design Engine

The V2 Design Engine is not a universal responsive-layout converter. Its job is to decide **how much automation a wearable surface should accept** and to preserve meaningful product differences between circle, pill and rectangular screens.

> Automation removes repetition. Art direction owns meaningful differences.

The current runtime/Scene contract is described in [REWRITE_V2_ARCHITECTURE.md](REWRITE_V2_ARCHITECTURE.md).

## 1. Design Freedom levels

### L1 — Auto

Use L1 when the page is structurally ordinary and the product meaning does not depend on a unique visual composition.

Typical examples:

- settings menus;
- simple detail pages;
- ordinary paged lists;
- straightforward forms and controls.

The Engine may resolve:

- safe geometry;
- page capacity;
- spacing and card dimensions;
- typography scale;
- fixed pager placement.

L1 does **not** mean that every shape receives identical coordinates. A circle may need a fixed chord-aware frame while a tall pill may use spare vertical space. The rule is that these differences are resolved by the Design Spec rather than scattered as ad-hoc device checks throughout page logic.

Current reference: `src/pages/settings/settings` with `src/v2/design/specs/settings_menu.js`.

### L2 — Assisted

Use L2 when product semantics are shared but the best visual expression changes meaningfully by form factor.

Typical examples:

- health and history dashboards;
- activity and workout views;
- dense status pages;
- media or summary surfaces.

L2 shares Domain/Feature state and semantic values, then deliberately chooses a form-factor-specific composition.

Current `History` reference:

- **Circle** → compact tracked vertical bars, short weekday labels, small centered insight cards;
- **Pill** → `vertical-comparative-trend`: weekday/today label on the left, short thick horizontal comparison bar in the middle, complete step value on the right;
- **Rect** → dashboard composition using wider horizontal space.

The previous daily-record presentation was intentionally removed because it duplicated the same information and produced unstable layouts. L2 should prefer a clear summary hierarchy instead of preserving every old visual element.

`Health` follows the same principle: a circular screen may use the full 192×192 scroll canvas with chord-aware sections rather than being reduced to an inscribed rectangle.

### L3 — Free

Use L3 when the interaction or visual model itself is a major part of the product.

Typical examples:

- watchfaces;
- honeycomb launchers;
- games;
- strongly branded/experimental surfaces.

The Engine supplies the Scene, safe geometry, shared semantics and optional helpers, but it does not force one composition onto all shapes.

Current launcher strategy:

- Circle → Honeycomb;
- Pill → paged list;
- Rect → designed grid.

Current watchface strategy includes form-factor-specific components such as the circular mechanical face and the pill Alpine face. These surfaces may use deterministic absolute geometry because visual precision is more important than generic layout reuse.

## 2. Shape language

The stable product language is:

### Circle

Use the circular canvas as a circle, not as a small central rectangle.

- place titles and footers in narrow chord-safe zones;
- place wide cards near the center where the chord is widest;
- keep bottom summaries away from the lower arc;
- prefer compact radial/tracked visualizations;
- scroll through the full round canvas when the content naturally exceeds one screen.

### Pill

Use the long vertical axis as an advantage.

- prefer vertical information flow;
- use tall, readable cards;
- use horizontal comparison bars when seven vertical columns would become cramped;
- keep full-bleed backgrounds independent from top/bottom interaction comfort;
- reserve right-side numeric columns when exact values matter.

### Rect

Use the additional horizontal room.

- dashboards and two-column grids are appropriate;
- pair visualizations with insight columns where useful;
- avoid inheriting tall-pill spacing when the rectangle can present information side-by-side.

## 3. Full-bleed Scene vs safe content

Every Design decision starts from the full Design Scene, then applies safe geometry to content.

```text
Full Design Scene
  ├─ decorative/background layers: may reach the edge
  └─ semantic content
       ├─ title / controls / values: safe/chord-aware
       └─ scrolling sections: shape-aware viewport + readable internal geometry
```

Do not crop the Scene to manufacture safety. A rounded end, circular arc or gesture zone should influence foreground placement, not create artificial black bands in the background.

## 4. Wearable layout reliability rules

The following implementation rules are part of the Design Engine because they have direct visual consequences on Vela:

- A surface whose children are all `position:absolute` must still have an explicit width and height. Otherwise the parent may collapse and render as a black page.
- Avoid relying on percentage widths for compact text controls when Vela measurement can collapse them. Resolve explicit shape-aware pixel geometry when the dimensions are product-critical.
- Use `overflow:hidden` only when clipping is genuinely part of the visual design. Do not use it to hide mistakes in Scene geometry.
- Do not assume first-mount flex measurement is identical to a later remount for precision watchfaces. Prefer deterministic geometry where available.
- Static safe geometry and scrolling flow are different concepts. A long list does not need every row to fit inside the safe rectangle at the same time.

## 5. Design View boundary

Pages should receive display-ready values from Design Views where presentation semantics are involved.

Examples:

- formatted step values;
- `今天` / weekday labels;
- comparative bar widths;
- selected state colors;
- capability/status text.

The page should not duplicate Domain calculations or invent a second presentation model.

A typical V2 flow is:

```text
Domain model
   ↓
Feature Controller
   ↓
Design Spec (geometry / freedom / surface)
   +
Design View (display-ready semantics)
   ↓
Page
```

## 6. Interaction is part of the design

Visual freedom does not mean arbitrary gesture behavior.

The product should preserve stable navigation semantics:

- page-level navigation gestures have one owner;
- nested visual components must not compete for the same navigation gesture;
- a native swipe and a raw-touch compatibility fallback may coexist only when they belong to the same owner and produce the same semantic action;
- paged surfaces should provide a visible alternative (for example arrows) when appropriate.

## 7. Choosing a level for new work

Before implementing a new page or major redesign:

1. identify shared functional semantics;
2. estimate information density, shape sensitivity and interaction specificity;
3. recommend L1, L2 or L3;
4. define the shape strategy before writing page markup;
5. keep Domain/Feature behavior shared unless the product behavior itself differs;
6. validate pill, circle and rectangular targets;
7. if an L1 result becomes cramped or unreadable, promote the surface to L2 instead of repeatedly shrinking fonts and cards.

The Design Freedom level is a product decision, not merely a technical optimization.

## 8. Current reference surfaces

| Surface | Freedom | Stable shape strategy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Settings menu | L1 | auto/paged; circle uses fixed chord-aware frame |
| History | L2 | circle tracked bars / pill vertical comparison / rect dashboard |
| Health | L2 | shared metrics with full round composition on circle |
| Workout | L2 | shared session semantics with shape-specific dashboard composition |
| Launcher | L3 | circle honeycomb / pill list / rect grid |
| Watchfaces | L3 | art-directed components per supported form factor |

These references are examples, not a requirement that future pages copy their exact styling.
